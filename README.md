- Description:

- This addon enhances the loading screen experience for the HL2 Campaign gamemode in Garryâ€™s Mod. It features a custom HTML-based loading screen that dynamically saves a screenshot every time the player reaches the end of a map. The saved screenshot is then displayed during the next loading screen, providing a seamless and immersive transition between maps.

- Key Features:

    - Custom HTML loading screen for a personalized look.

    - Automatically captures and displays in-game screenshots at the end of each map.

    -- Deletes the screenshot file upon loading to save space.

- Known Issues:

    - Does not check which map the player is transitioning to.

    - Lacks specific map file naming for screenshots.

    - Currently tied to the HL2 Campaign gamemode (compatibility with other gamemodes is planned).

- Future Plans:

    - Make the addon compatible with gamemodes other than HL2 Campaign.

    - Improve map detection and screenshot file naming for better organization.
